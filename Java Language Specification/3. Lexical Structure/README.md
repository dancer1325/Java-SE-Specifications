* Programs are written in Unicode / exist lexical translations
  * -> Unicode characters can be included -- via Unicode escapes -- ONLY using ASCII characters
  * unicode characters / result of lexical translation == input elements == white space + comments + tokens
    * tokens == identifiers + keywords + literals + separators + operators
* line terminators
  * -- allows supporting -- different conventions of host systems / maintain consistent line numbers
