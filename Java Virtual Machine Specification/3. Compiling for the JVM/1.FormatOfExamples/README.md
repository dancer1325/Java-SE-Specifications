  * == examples of source code + examples' listings of the JVM code
    * listings -- are generated by -- `javac` Oracleâ€™s JDK v1.0.2  
* informal VM assembly language
  * ðŸ‘€ uses
    * JVM code ðŸ‘€
  * == `javap`'s output / contained by JDK
  * `<index> <opcode> [ <operand1> [ <operand2>... ]] [<comment>]`
    * TODO:

The <index> is the index of the opcode of the instruction in the array that contains the bytes of Java Virtual Machine code for this method. 
Alternatively, the <index> may be thought of as a byte offset from the beginning of the method. The <opcode> is the mnemonic for the instruction's opcode, and the zero or more <operandN> are the operands of the instruction. 
The optional <comment> is given in end-of-line comment syntax:
