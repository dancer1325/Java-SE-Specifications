* ALL previous chapters : 1! statement OR expression / time == 1! thread
* If you use >1 thread
  * -> execute code | values & objects / shared main memory
  * -- can be supported by -- many hardware processors
    * 1! hardware processor / time-slicing
    * \>1 hardware processor / time-slicing
* `Thread`
  * class / represent threads
  * ONLY way to create a thread -- create a `Thread`'s instance
  * `start()` starts a thread
  * 👁️synchronize the threads is crucial 👁️
* Goal of the chapter
  * Java programming language memory model
    * 👁️semantics of multithreaded programs / similar | different hardware architectures 👁️
    * allowed behaviors by multithreaded programs
