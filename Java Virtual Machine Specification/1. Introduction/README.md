* Java programming language
  * characteristics
    * general-purpose
    * concurrent
    * object-oriented
  * syntax == C or C++ / omit features
  * 👁️ original-purpose == software -- for -- networked consumer devices 👁️
    * -> requirements
      * compiled code -- had to survive -- transport across networks
      * operate | any client
      * safe to run
* WWW
  * made popular -> made it more interesting
  * HTML
    * limited
    * HotJava browser
      * == programs embedded | HTML pages
* JVM
  * 👁️ == cornerstone of the Java platform 👁️
  * == abstract computing machine
    * -> 
      * set of instructions + memory area manipulation | run time
    * available |
      * mobile
      * desktop
      * server devices
      * silicon CPU
      * microcode
  * allows
    * Java is independent of
      * hardware
      * OS
    * small size of compiled code
    * protecting users -- from -- malicious programs
  * previous VM : P-Code machine of UCSD Pascal
  * `.class` 
    * ⭐JUST know about Java programming language, by the JVM ⭐ 
    * == binary format / 
      * contains JVM instructions + symbol table + other information
      * strong syntactic AND structural constraints | it / -- imposed by the -- JVM 
    * 👁️ ANY language / functionality -- can be expressed in terms of -- `.class` -> can be hosted | JVM 👁️
